# Model View Controller Example
MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern that separates the application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller.

Model: The model represents the data and the business logic of the application.
View: The view represents the user interface of the application.
Controller: The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.
