# Model View Controller Example
MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern that separates the application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller.

Model:  
- The model represents the data and the business logic of the application.  
View:  
- The view represents the user interface of the application.  
Controller:  
- The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.
